# The Backend System Design

The Backend system architecture represents a crop recommendation platform that integrates 
user inputs, external data sources such as weather and geographical information, and a 
database to generate tailored farming advice through an AI-driven recommendation engine. 
The process flows from a user interface through an API gateway, containing data processing 
in an application server, and combining the AI-powered recommendations.
