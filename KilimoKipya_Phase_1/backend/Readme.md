# The Backend System Design

The Backend system architecture represents a crop recommendation platform that integrates 
user inputs, external data sources such as weather and geographical information, and a 
database to generate tailored farming advice through an AI-driven recommendation engine. 
The process flows from a user interface through an API gateway, containing data processing 
in an application server, and combining the AI-powered recommendations.

## ERD Diagram
An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a high-level conceptual data model used in 
software system development. It graphically represents entities, their attributes, and the 
relationships between entities within a system. ERDs are pivotal in database design, serving as 
a graphical tool to represent data concepts and their relationships within an organization.

Below is an entity relationship diagram showing the high-level conceptual 
data model of the Integrated Crop Recommendation System interaction:
