# AI System

## Overview
This part focuses on developing an AI system for crop and fertilzer model training and comparison. The repository contains data, model training scripts, and notebooks used for evaluating and comparing different models.

## Folder Structure
- **Data/**: Contains all the datasets used for training and evaluation.
- **Improved Modelling/**: Includes the trained models and related files.
- **Notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks used for training, evaluating, and comparing models.
  - `modelcomparison.png`: Visualization of model comparison results.
  - `modelscomparison2.png`: Additional visualization of model comparison results
     ```
1. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Install necessary Python packages using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run Jupyter Notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter Notebook to explore and run the scripts in `playground.ipynb`:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage
- **Data Preparation**: Place your dataset in the `Data/` directory.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Open `notebooks` in Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions to train and evaluate the models.
- **Visualization**: Review `modelcomparison.png` and `modelscomparison2.png` for visual insights on model performance.
